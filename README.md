# Hangman Game

## Description:

- This project is part of a student project to demonstrate the newly learned skills with React.

## How To Play The Game

- The CPU generates a word or phrase.
- NB: FOR WORDS OR PHRASES WITH DASHES: The CPU draws the equivalent dashes letters in the word.
-  The player has to guess one letter at a time.(inclusive of dashes)
- If the player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the CPU fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places.
- Too many incorrect guesses results in a loss

## Objective
